=head1 NAME

pactrans, pacinstall, pacremove - install/remove alpm packages

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 pactrans   [options] <target>...
 pacinstall [options] <target>...
 pacremove  [options] <target>...
 pactrans   (--help|--version)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Install/remove alpm packages.  The B<pacinstall> and B<pacremove> aliases
are provided as a convenience, differing only in their default interpretation
of I<targets>.  Otherwise, they are identical.

An argument of C<-> may be provided to read the list of targets from standard
input, equivalent to C<--read-fd=0>.

=head1 OPTIONS

=head2 Operations

Operation options affect the interpretation of all targets following them until
another operation option is encountered.

=over

=item B<--spec> (B<pactrans> default)

Interpret following targets as I<pkgspec>s.  If a I<pkgspec> indicates
a package file or a repository package, it will be installed.  If it indicates
a package in the local database, it will be removed.  See L<PKGSPEC> for
details on the format.

=item B<--install> (B<pacinstall> default)

Interpret following targets as packages to be installed from a repository.  If
only the package name is provided repositories will be searched in the order
they are declared.

=item B<--remove> (B<pacremove> default)

Interpret following targets as package names to be uninstalled.

=item B<--file>

Interpret following targets as paths to package files to be installed.

=item B<--sysupgrade>

Upgrade installed packages.

immediately upon encountering this option.
