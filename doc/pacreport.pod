INI-style configuration file listing paths to ignore when run with
B<--unowned-files>.  Paths which should always be ignored may be specified with
C<IgnoreUnowned> in the C<Options> section.  Paths which should only be ignored
if a particular package is installed can be listed under the section
C<PkgIgnoreUnowned> using the package name as the option name and the path to
be ignored as the value.  All options can be specified multiple times.  Paths
may include shell-style globs.  The installation root should not be included in
paths.

 IgnoreUnowned = home/*
 IgnoreUnowned = proc/*
 IgnoreUnowned = mnt/*
