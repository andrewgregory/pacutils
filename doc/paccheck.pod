=head1 CAVEATS

B<paccheck> determines whether or not to read packages from F<stdin> based on
a naive check using L<isatty(3)>.  If B<paccheck> is called in an environment,
such as a shell function or script being used in a pipe, where F<stdin> is not
connected to a terminal but does not contain packages to check, B<paccheck>
should be called with F<stdin> closed.  For POSIX-compatible shells, this can
be done with C<< <&- >>.
